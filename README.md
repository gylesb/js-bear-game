# Super Galactic Age Calculator

This App determines a user’s age based on a planet’s solar years. A solar year lasts 365 days on planet Earth. However, the length of a solar year varies from planet to planet. For instance, a solar year on Mercury lasts 88 days.

## Specifications

* 1. User inputs their age and it is converted to seconds. This is the simplest test to see that the ToSeconds method is functioning properly.

 Sample Input: 1
 Sample Output: 60

* 2. User can enter a birthdate and the application can compare the birthdate against the current time to come up with an accurate age on Earth.

 Sample Input: 8-8-1968, 11-17-17
 Sample Output: 49

* 3. User can enter a birthdate and the application can return their age in Mercury years.

 Sample Input: 8-8-1968
 Sample Output: 11

* 4. User can enter a birthdate and the application can return their age in Venus years.

 Sample Input: 8-8-1968

 Sample Input: 8-8-1968
 Sample Output: 92

* 6. User can enter a birthdate and the application can return their age in Jupiter years.

 Sample Input: 8-8-1968
 Sample Output: 581

* 7. User inputs their birthdate and chooses any planet to learn what their life expectancy will be on that planet.

 Sample Input: 8-8-1968, Venus
 Sample Output: 50

* 8. User inputs their birthdate and chooses any planet to learn what their life expectancy will be or if they have  already outlived their life expectancy on that planet.

 Sample Input: 8-8-1968, Jupiter
 Sample Output: Congratulations, you have outlived your life expectancy for this planet.
